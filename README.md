# Military Pay Calculator
This project is a basic pay calculator for military base pay. Currently it is a Python program
that calculates a bi-weekly, monthly, yearly pay for a given officer rank. Next steps are to 
add enlisted and warrant officer ranks, add housing allowance and special pays, and create a flask app.
